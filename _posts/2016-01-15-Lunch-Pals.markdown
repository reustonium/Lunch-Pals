Lunch Pals has been used in an alpha state for just over two years now.  With the last active development coming in March 2014.  The time has come to revisit the app, apply modern application design and polish the user experience.

A couple of goals included in this app refresh include:  

* Implement MVP design pattern
* CI with automated tests
* Use Material Design
* Implement Friend Request's
* Create custom 'Nudge' animation
* Review past 2 years of useage
